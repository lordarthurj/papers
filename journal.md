# Title
Measurements-model comparison of biomass burning emissions over emissions over
West Africa

#Abstract
Always write this last, because it is most dificult to write

# Introduction
Joe Arturo 2004, in course this morning, please not interrupt,
he will be busy all day

Haywood et al 1999 were the pionners of this type of measurement.

# Simulations
John has an awsome box model that he is using to simulate particle growth downwind of the fires.

#Metodology
We use an AMS to measure particle mass and chemical composition.
The AMS is discribed in Allen et al 2014.

# Results
The simulation was able to reproduce the onserved particle growth, so it's due to
coagulation rather than condensation.

# Conclutions
We found some stuff, but give us more money to find out more stuff.

# Figures
this is where the figures go in a draft.
